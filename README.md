Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a technique used to study gene expression at the single-cell level. It provides insights into cellular heterogeneity and helps identify distinct and rare cell types.

## âœ… What We Did

- ðŸ“¥ Collected and preprocessed scRNA-seq data  
- ðŸ§¹ Applied quality control and filtering (cells & genes)  
- ðŸ“Š Normalized and log-transformed the data  
- ðŸ“‰ Performed dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP)  
- ðŸ”— Clustered cells using unsupervised learning methods  
- ðŸ§  Identified and visualized distinct cell populations  
- ðŸ“Œ Interpreted clusters based on known marker genes

scRNA-seq is a fast-evolving field, and this project provided hands-on experience with its main analysis pipeline using real-world data.
